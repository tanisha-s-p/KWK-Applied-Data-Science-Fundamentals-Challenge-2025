Deepseek

* Helped fix label spacing and positioning in graphs
* Guided how material composition could be parsed from window.__REACT_QUERY_STATE__ for C&A scraper
* Helped detect formatting patterns to design regex code
* Asked it the meaning of error messages to help me debug my code

Claude

* Generated a prototype data dashboard for exploratory analysis
* Note: many values were hallucinated, but it inspired my own analytical approach

YouTube Tutorial
* Followed this Scrapy tutorial to understand how to use Scrapy to scrape an e-commerce site: https://youtu.be/4WjNFv2RPo0?si=840EBLvfCmpDVOuX
* Some scrapy code was inspired by this video, but was then adapted and extended for my project
